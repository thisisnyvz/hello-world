# hello-world

My name is <strong>Nieves de la Cruz</strong>.

I love :coffee: :pizza:, and :computer:.

I live in <strong>Bacolod City</strong>, Philippines.

My first job was way back <strong>2007</strong>.

I became a <em>customer service</em>, <em>technical</em> and <em>email specialist</em> handling different accounts.

I also became a <em><strong>Team Leader</strong></em> for the last 6 years handling around 16 people.

I am responsible for motivating my team as well as inspiring positive communication so we can work together toward achieving our <em><strong>goals</strong></em> and <em><strong>commitments</strong></em>.

During my free time, I love going out and spend my rest days at the beach or going camping.

I also love to <em><strong>draw</strong></em> and <em><strong>paint</strong></em> on canvas oil whenever I am inspired of something.

That's all about me. :heart:
